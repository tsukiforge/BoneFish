# BoneFish Release Notes

## v3.9.0 - Extreme Performance (Potato Mode), Night Vision & Anti Not-Responding

Release date: 2026-07-03

Highlights
- Added **Extreme Performance preset** ("🥔 Potato Mode") — the most aggressive optimization tier, targeting dual-core laptops with <4GB RAM and no dedicated GPU
- Added **Night Vision** toggle (client-side only) — brightens dark areas in-game without affecting other players or the server
- Added **Anti Not-Responding** system — 3-layer protection against freeze/crash on low-end hardware using FastFlags + process-level optimizations
- Added **ForceExtremeMode** override — force Potato Mode regardless of auto-detected hardware tier
- Added **configurable FPS cap** for Extreme/UltraLow mode (24–60 fps slider, default 30)

Extreme Performance (Potato Mode) — what's disabled
- All shadow rendering (`FIntRenderShadowIntensity=0`, `DFFlagDebugPauseVoxelizer`, voxelizer fade radius)
- All post-processing (`FFlagDisablePostFx` — bloom, color correction, sun rays, depth of field)
- SSAO / ambient occlusion (`FFlagDebugSSAOForce=False`, `FIntSSAOMipLevels=0`)
- GUI blur on ESC menu (`FIntRobloxGuiBlurIntensity=0`)
- Grass, foliage & global wind simulation
- Terrain texture detail (`FIntTerrainArraySliceSize=0`)
- Water reflections & PBR (forced Voxel lighting via `DFFlagDebugRenderForceTechnologyVoxel`)
- CSGv2 LOD generation on load (`DFIntCSGv2LodsToGenerate=0`)
- Texture compositor low-res factor + reduced compositor jobs
- Light attenuation fallback to legacy model
- Texture quality forced to level 0, FRM quality level 1, MSAA x1, mesh LOD minimum

Anti Not-Responding — 3-layer system
1. **FastFlags** (applied before Roblox launches):
   - `DFIntMaxActiveAnimationTracks=32` — cuts Lua GC pressure (default is 200+)
   - `FIntRenderLocalLightFadeInMs=0` — removes per-frame light fade work on main thread
   - 7× `FFlagDebugDisableTelemetry*` — eliminates background telemetry thread wakeups
2. **Process priority** (800ms after Roblox starts): Roblox process set to `AboveNormal` — Windows scheduler gives it more CPU time, reduces preemption from background apps
3. **RAM trim** (only on devices <5GB RAM): `EmptyWorkingSet()` called on all non-critical background processes before Roblox finishes loading — frees physical RAM pages back to the OS. System-critical processes (svchost, dwm, explorer, lsass, etc.) are skipped. Amount freed is logged.
   - Bonus: on dual-core devices, BoneFish pins itself to core 0 to reduce L2 cache contention with Roblox

Night Vision — how it works (client-side only)
- `FFlagFastGPULightCulling3=True` — more ambient light sources processed per frame, dark areas appear brighter as a side effect
- `FFlagNewLightAttenuation=True` — softer light falloff, gradual dark-to-bright transition instead of hard black walls
- `FIntRenderLocalLightUpdatesMax=8` — torches/flashlights update more often, felt radius is wider
- Confirmation dialog shown on first activation: "Are you sure — aktifkan Night Vision?"
- State is persisted across sessions via `Settings.EnableNightVision`
- Toggling off restores Potato Mode values (attenuation False, Max=4)

Known issues fixed from v3.3.x
- **Mic not showing in Roblox voice chat**: FACS pipeline flags (`DFIntAnimationLodFacsDistanceMin/Max/Denominator`) intentionally NOT used — setting these to 0 also kills the voice activity indicator since Roblox uses the same pipeline for facial capture and voice input
- **Flashlight/torch bug (permanent black area)**: `FIntRenderLocalLightUpdatesMax` raised from 1 → 4 (Potato Mode) / 8 (Night Vision) — value of 1 caused light positions to not update fast enough when moving
- **Not responding more frequent**: `DFIntDebugRestrictGCDistance=1` removed — too aggressive, caused RAM spike when moving between areas as engine had to reload all discarded assets simultaneously

Developer notes
- New settings: `ForceExtremeMode` (bool), `ExtremeModeFpsTarget` (int, default 30), `EnableNightVision` (bool)
- New public method: `AutoOptimizeService.OptimizeRobloxProcess(int pid)` — called from `Bootstrapper.StartRoblox()` 800ms post-launch when `OptimizeForLowEnd=true` and `LaunchMode=Player`
- New private method: `AutoOptimizeService.TrimBackgroundProcesses(int robloxPid)` — P/Invoke `EmptyWorkingSet` via `psapi.dll`, only runs on systems with <5GB RAM
- P/Invoke additions in `AutoOptimizeService.cs`: `OpenProcess`, `EmptyWorkingSet`, `CloseHandle` (kernel32 + psapi)
- `ManagedFlags[]` updated to include all new flags — `RemoveOptimizations()` cleans up correctly when mode is disabled
- Night Vision flags managed separately from ManagedFlags (toggled independently via `ToggleNightVision()`)

Changelog (technical)
- `Bloxstrap/Integrations/AutoOptimizeService.cs`: added Extreme tier, 20+ new FastFlags, `OptimizeRobloxProcess()`, `TrimBackgroundProcesses()`, P/Invoke declarations, updated `ManagedFlags[]`
- `Bloxstrap/Bootstrapper.cs`: added `OptimizeRobloxProcess` hook after Roblox start with 800ms delay
- `Bloxstrap/UI/ViewModels/Settings/FastFlagsViewModel.cs`: added `ApplyExtremePerformancePreset()`, `ToggleNightVision()`, `NightVisionEnabled`, `ForceExtremeMode`, `ExtremeModeFpsTarget` properties, `ToggleNightVisionCommand`
- `Bloxstrap/UI/Elements/Settings/Pages/FastFlagsPage.xaml`: added Potato Mode card (with "PALING AGRESIF" badge), Force Extreme Mode toggle, FPS cap slider, Night Vision card (with "CLIENT-SIDE ONLY" badge)
- `Bloxstrap/Models/Persistable/Settings.cs`: added `ForceExtremeMode`, `ExtremeModeFpsTarget`, `EnableNightVision`

## v3.3.3 - Experimental features: Notifications & FPS Monitor (optimized for low-end)

Release date: 2026-06-04

Highlights
- Added Windows-native notifications for Roblox (friend online, general notifications)
- Added FPS Monitor Overlay (real-time FPS + frame time)
- Added "Optimize for low-end devices" setting to reduce CPU usage on older hardware

Quick links
- Experimental settings: Settings > Experimental
- Notifications docs: NOTIFICATION_FEATURE.md
- FPS Monitor docs: FPS_MONITOR_FEATURE.md

Low-end optimizations (what changed)
- FPS Monitor UI updates are throttled when "Optimize for low-end devices" is enabled (update interval increases from 1s → 2s)
- Frame counting uses CompositionTarget.Rendering (lightweight) instead of a 1ms timer — reduces CPU wakeups
- Preallocated brushes used for color coding to avoid allocations every update
- Notification polling interval increases from 5s → 15s when low-end optimization is enabled
- Less frequent updates and lighter rendering to keep gameplay smooth on older laptops

How to enable low-end optimizations
1. Open BoneFish
2. Go to Settings → Experimental
3. Enable "Optimalkan untuk perangkat low-end (Rendah)"

Developer notes
- Settings added: `OptimizeForLowEnd` (bool), `EnableFpsMonitor` (bool), `FpsMonitorX` (double), `FpsMonitorY` (double)
- Notification polling delay now respects `OptimizeForLowEnd`
- FPS Monitor update interval respects `OptimizeForLowEnd`

Known limitations & further work
- Overlay measures WPF render frames; it may not perfectly reflect in-game GPU-rendered FPS
- Future improvements: memory/GPU usage stats, performance graph, adaptive quality changes

Changelog (technical)
- Bloxstrap/Integrations/RobloxNotification.cs: notification polling interval adjusted for low-end mode
- Bloxstrap/UI/Elements/FpsMonitorOverlay.xaml.cs: switched to CompositionTarget.Rendering for frame counting, throttled UI updates, reduced allocations
- Bloxstrap/Integrations/FpsMonitorService.cs: initialized based on setting
- Bloxstrap/Models/Persistable/Settings.cs: new settings added
- Bloxstrap/UI/Elements/Settings/Pages/ExperimentalPage.xaml: new toggles added
- Bloxstrap/UI/ViewModels/Settings/ExperimentalViewModel.cs: new properties for binding
